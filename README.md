# Program Descriptions

## 1. TwentyNine.java – Style #29: Actor Model

- Each "thing" (data loader, stop word filter, frequency counter) is a thread with a message queue.

- Threads only communicate by sending messages (Message objects) to each other’s queues.

- Fully decoupled, real actor-style simulation.

Concept: "Each actor does one thing. Everything is done by passing messages."

## 2. Thirty.java – Style #30: Dataspaces (Linda)

- A shared BlockingQueue (wordSpace) holds all words to be processed.

- Multiple worker threads consume words and produce local frequency maps.

- After all workers are done, maps are merged and printed.

Concept: "Workers dump to and pull from common data spaces."

## 3. ThirtyTwo.java – Style #32: Map-Reduce

- The input text is broken into chunks of ~200 lines.

- A map step splits each chunk into words and filters stop words.

- A group step regroups all words.

- A reduce step counts and sums frequencies.

- Finally, the result is sorted and printed.

Concept: "Chunk → Map → Regroup → Reduce → Print"
